📩 SMS Phishing Detection & Forensic Analysis
📌 Project Overview

This project detects and investigates phishing SMS attacks using machine learning and NLP.
Beyond binary classification, it focuses on intent analysis, campaign detection, multilingual robustness, and forensic explainability.

The system is tailored for real-world Indian phishing scenarios, including Hinglish and code-switched messages.

🎯 Project Goals

Detect phishing SMS with high confidence

Understand attacker intent and campaign structure

Support explainable NLP outputs for investigations

Adapt models using analyst feedback

🧠 Final Issue List (ML-Focused)
1. Context-Aware Conversation Modeling

Model SMS messages within conversation context using transformers.

2. Multilingual Code-Switching Detection

Handle mixed-language phishing messages common in India.

3. Phishing Intent Classification

Classify messages into intents such as lure, credential theft, or OTP fraud.

4. URL Risk Prediction Model

Predict malicious URLs using learned lexical and hosting features.

5. Adversarial SMS Generation

Generate adversarial phishing messages to test model robustness.

6. Confidence Calibration for NLP Predictions

Calibrate model confidence scores for reliable decision-making.

7. Weakly Supervised Learning

Train models using noisy or weak labels to reduce annotation cost.

8. Phishing Campaign Clustering

Group related SMS into coordinated phishing campaigns.

9. Explainable NLP for Forensics

Provide token-level explanations for phishing predictions.

10. Online Learning from Analyst Feedback

Update models incrementally based on investigator corrections.
