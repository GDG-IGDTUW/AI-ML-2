## 📂 Project Details  

### 1️⃣ **BAIDS**  

👩‍💼 **Description:**  
"BAIDS is a behavior-based Android Intrusion Detection System designed to identify suspicious and malicious activities on Android devices using digital forensic techniques and machine learning. 
The system analyzes artifacts extracted from Android logical images—such as app permissions, network activity (IPDR/DNS), SMS logs, call records, and GPS data—to detect anomalies indicative of malware, phishing attacks, SIM spoofing, or unauthorized access.

BAIDS correlates multi-source forensic evidence to build a unified behavioral profile of the device and applies anomaly detection models (e.g., Isolation Forest / Autoencoders) to flag deviations from normal usage patterns.
A Streamlit-based dashboard enables investigators to upload evidence, visualize timelines, map GPS movements, view risk scores, and generate forensic-ready reports with hash verification for evidentiary integrity."

👾 **Project Category:** 
Machine Learning

🌟 **Details:**  
- Android Intrusion Detection System
- Android logical images—such as app permissions, network activity (IPDR/DNS) etc 
- Marketing, Administration and R&D Cost, Location data given

### 2️⃣ **Android Malware Detection System**  

🏏 **Description:**  
This project focuses on detecting malicious Android applications through static forensic analysis and machine learning. 
The system extracts APK files from a logical Android image or folder and analyzes features such as requested permissions, API usage patterns, file entropy, cryptographic hashes, and PE/APK metadata.

Suspicious applications are identified using trained ML classifiers (e.g., SVM / Random Forest) and heuristic rules such as high-entropy payloads and use of dangerous APIs (e.g., SMS sending, device ID access). 
Optional threat intelligence integration allows hash comparison with known malware databases. 
Results are presented in an interactive GUI that highlights high-risk apps and supports exportable forensic reports.

👾 **Project Category:** 
Machine Learning

🌟 **Details:**  
- APK files from a logical Android image or folder
- static forensic analysis 
- ML

### 3️⃣ **SMS Phishing Detection & Forensic Analysis System**  

📚 **Description:**  
This project aims to detect and investigate phishing SMS messages using natural language processing and digital forensics. 
The system uses an NLP model (BERT-based / Hinglish-trained classifier) to classify SMS messages as phishing or legitimate, with confidence scoring and explainability.

Beyond classification, the tool performs forensic correlation by linking phishing SMS with related call logs, app launches, browser activity, and domain WHOIS data. 
Timeline-based visualization helps investigators reconstruct attack sequences and assess user impact. 
The system supports SMS extraction from logical images or live device input and generates court-ready analytical summaries.

👾 **Project Category:** 
Machine Learning

🌟 **Details:**  
- NLP model (BERT-based / Hinglish-trained classifier) 
- SMS extraction from logical images
- Live device input
