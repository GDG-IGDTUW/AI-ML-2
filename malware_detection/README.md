# 🦠 Android Malware Detection System
**📌 Project Overview**

This project focuses on machine learning–based Android malware detection using static analysis of APK files extracted from forensic images or datasets.
It combines permission analysis, entropy analysis, API usage patterns, and learned representations to detect malicious applications and malware families.

The system emphasizes explainability, robustness, and adaptability to evolving malware.

**🎯 Project Goals**

Detect malicious APKs using ML-driven feature analysis

Support explainable malware classification

Improve resilience against adversarial evasion

Enable continuous learning as malware evolves
